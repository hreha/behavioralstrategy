# Behavior Market Fit

**Behavior Market Fit** means identifying and clearly defining behaviors that your target audience can and will realistically perform to solve a validated market problem. It occurs only after establishing Problem Market Fit and before achieving Product Market Fit.

## Key Insight

Even clearly validated problems won't be solved unless the required behaviors align naturally with user capabilities, motivation, and context.

## Example

**Negative Example:** Google Glass required new social behaviors—like speaking to a wearable camera in public—that most users were unwilling or uncomfortable to adopt. Poor Behavior Market Fit contributed significantly to its failure.

**Positive Example:** Instagram succeeded by explicitly shifting from check-ins (low Behavior Market Fit, minimal adoption) to photo-sharing, a natural behavior aligned with users' existing habits and desires (high Behavior Market Fit).

> **Heuristic:** Identify realistic, natural behaviors clearly aligned with user motivation and context before designing products.
