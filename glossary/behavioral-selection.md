# Behavioral Selection

**Behavioral Selection** explicitly involves identifying and prioritizing the specific behaviors that, if adopted by your users, will reliably drive strategic outcomes and measurable success. It is a core process within the broader Behavioral Strategy discipline.

## Key Insight

Not all behaviors are equally impactful; rigorous selection clearly identifies behaviors with the highest potential for measurable strategic results.

## Example

A subscription-based business aiming to increase renewals may use Behavioral Selection to identify behaviors strongly correlated with retention, such as users engaging weekly with a key feature or sharing content regularly. Clearly targeting these selected behaviors directly improves renewal rates.

## Practical Steps

1. Clearly define measurable strategic goals.
2. Conduct behavioral research to identify candidate behaviors.
3. Evaluate and prioritize behaviors based explicitly on impact and feasibility.

> **Heuristic:** Explicitly select and prioritize behaviors that directly drive your measurable strategic outcomes.
