# Problem Market Fit

**Problem Market Fit** is achieved when a clearly defined problem is recognized as significant and urgent by a specific user group who actively seeks a solution. It represents the essential first step before designing behaviors or products.

## Key Insight

Many products fail not due to execution but because they attempt to solve a problem that users don't perceive as important or painful enough.

## Example

**Negative Example (No Problem Market Fit):** Juicero created a $400 device that squeezed pre-packaged juice bags, addressing a problem customers never considered meaningful enough to solve at this price point. The lack of Problem Market Fit led directly to its market failure.

**Positive Example:** Airbnb achieved strong Problem Market Fit because it addressed a clear, validated problem—travelers seeking affordable, authentic, short-term accommodation alternatives.

> **Heuristic:** Clearly validate user problems before designing solutions or behaviors.
