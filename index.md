# Behavioral Strategy

**Behavioral Strategy** is an emerging interdisciplinary discipline that integrates behavioral science at the earliest stages of strategic decision-making. It ensures optimal outcomes by identifying and embedding evidence-based behaviors directly into new products, services, and strategic initiatives.

## Key Insight

Embedding behavioral interventions during the planning phase consistently outperforms intuition-driven or reactive solutions.

### Evidence

Products and strategies explicitly designed around validated human behaviors and clearly identified user problems demonstrate significantly higher adoption rates and greater long-term engagement compared to intuition-driven or reactive approaches.

## The Behavioral Strategy Hierarchy

Behavioral Strategy clearly defines three foundational "fits" essential for strategic success:

1. **[Problem Market Fit](/glossary/problem-market-fit/):** Ensuring users actively experience and seek solutions to a clearly defined problem.
2. **[Behavior Market Fit](/glossary/behavior-market-fit/):** Matching user behaviors precisely to the validated problem.
3. **Product Market Fit:** Building products or services that sustainably enable and scale the identified behaviors.

By sequentially validating these fits, organizations significantly enhance their likelihood of creating impactful and successful products and strategies.

> **Heuristic:** Verify Problem Market Fit first, Behavior Market Fit second, and Product Market Fit third.

## Why Behavioral Strategy Matters

Most products, services, or strategic initiatives fail due to misalignment with human behavior and insufficient problem validation. Traditional approaches often overlook how target customers naturally behave or whether they genuinely seek a solution, resulting in low adoption and minimal impact.

Behavioral Strategy ensures alignment between business objectives, real user problems, and achievable behaviors, dramatically increasing the likelihood of achieving lasting strategic success.

## Practical Steps

1. **Define measurable objectives explicitly.**
2. **Clearly identify your target user.** ([See the Target User Definition step](/methodology/target-user/))
3. **Conduct comprehensive behavioral research.** ([Understand the Behavioral Research phase](/methodology/behavioral-research/))
4. **Rank behaviors systematically based on impact and feasibility.** ([Explore Behavior Ranking](/methodology/behavior-ranking/))
5. **Select and embed behaviors strategically into your products or initiatives.** ([Learn about Designing Products and Services](/methodology/designing-products/))

## Core Behavioral Strategy Concepts

- [Problem Market Fit](/glossary/problem-market-fit/): Clearly identifying a substantial problem users actively seek solutions for.
- [Behavior Market Fit](/glossary/behavior-market-fit/): Matching user behaviors precisely to market needs.
- [Behavioral Selection](/glossary/behavioral-selection/): Identifying specific behaviors critical for strategic outcomes.
- [Behavioral Innovation](/glossary/behavioral-innovation/): Designing entirely new behaviors to overcome persistent user problems.

## Applications of Behavioral Strategy

Behavioral Strategy has proven transformative across multiple industries:

- **Technology:** Instagram achieved massive growth after pivoting from check-ins to photo sharing, exemplifying perfect Behavior Market Fit ([Technology Case Study](/applications/technology/)).
- **Healthcare:** Innovative vaccine approaches considering psychological barriers can substantially reduce vaccine hesitancy ([Healthcare Application](/applications/healthcare/)).
