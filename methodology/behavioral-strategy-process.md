# Behavioral Strategy Process

A structured, evidence-based framework explicitly weaving behavioral science into strategy from day one. By following four disciplined steps—**select, validate, embed, and measure** target behaviors—organizations explicitly increase their odds of delivering products, services, or interventions that drive measurable, repeatable outcomes.

## The Four-Step Framework

The Behavioral Strategy Process explicitly comprises these four clearly defined steps:

1. **Select:** Clearly identify behaviors critical for achieving measurable outcomes. ([Behavioral Selection](/methodology/behavioral-selection/))
2. **Validate:** Explicitly research and validate these behaviors against user needs, motivations, and contexts. ([Behavioral Research](/methodology/behavioral-research/))
3. **Embed:** Clearly integrate validated behaviors into products, services, or interventions. ([Designing Products, Services, or Interventions](/methodology/designing-products/))
4. **Measure:** Continuously measure explicit outcomes and behaviors, refining strategies clearly based on feedback.

> **Heuristic:** Explicitly select, validate, embed, and measure behaviors from day one to ensure strategic clarity and measurable success.
