# Behavioral Strategy Process — Overview

Behavioral Strategy is an open, interdisciplinary field integrating behavioral science into strategic decision-making. By identifying validated user problems, behaviors, and solutions from the outset, teams improve the likelihood of achieving sustainable outcomes.

## Key Insight

Across sectors such as tech, healthcare, and finance, projects that embed behavioral evidence during planning consistently outperform intuition-driven strategies.

These performance gains appear repeatedly in published case studies and practitioner reports.

## The Behavioral Strategy Hierarchy

Behavioral Strategy defines four foundational "fits":

1. **[Problem Market Fit](/glossary/problem-market-fit/):** Ensuring users actively seek solutions to clearly defined problems.

2. **[Behavior Market Fit](/glossary/behavior-market-fit/):** Matching user behaviors precisely to validated problems.  
   *It represents the evidence-backed alignment between target behaviors and real-world problems.*

3. **[Solution Market Fit](/glossary/solution-market-fit/):** Identifying solutions—whether products, services, or interventions—that effectively enable desired behaviors.

4. **[Product Market Fit](/glossary/product-market-fit/) (optional):** Specifically validating market-ready products as effective and sustainable solutions.

This sequence is central to various frameworks and remains free for anyone to adapt.

> **Heuristic:** Verify **[Problem Market Fit](/glossary/problem-market-fit/)**, then **[Behavior Market Fit](/glossary/behavior-market-fit/)**, and finally **[Solution Market Fit](/glossary/solution-market-fit/)** (or **[Product Market Fit](/glossary/product-market-fit/)** if specifically applicable).

## Why Behavioral Strategy Matters

Most initiatives fail due to misalignment with real user behaviors. Behavioral Strategy ensures alignment between user problems, achievable behaviors, and solutions, dramatically improving strategic outcomes.

## Practical Steps

1. **Define measurable objectives.**
2. **Identify your target user.** ([See Target User Definition](/methodology/target-user/))
3. **Conduct behavioral research.** ([Explore Behavioral Research](/methodology/behavioral-research/))
4. **Prioritize behaviors by impact and feasibility.** ([Review Behavior Ranking](/methodology/behavior-ranking/))
5. **Select and embed behaviors strategically** (see available playbooks, e.g., the [DRIVE framework](/methodology/drive-framework/)).

**Available playbooks include:**
