# DRIVE Framework — Five-Step Behavioral Strategy Playbook

The DRIVE framework provides organizations with a structured, evidence-based method to embed behavioral science into strategic planning. By clearly defining problems, behaviors, and solutions upfront, teams improve strategic outcomes and sustainably influence user behaviors.¹

## The Five-Step DRIVE Framework

### 1. **Define**

Clearly identify strategic goals, target users, and core problems to ensure [Problem Market Fit](/glossary/problem-market-fit/).

*Example:* Instagram defined their strategic goal—boosting engagement—then identified user behaviors (photo-sharing) aligned with that goal.

### 2. **Research**

Conduct rigorous behavioral research to validate and prioritize behaviors, ensuring strong [Behavior Market Fit](/glossary/behavior-market-fit/).

*Example:* Instagram’s research showed users strongly preferred photo-sharing over location check-ins, guiding their app redesign.

### 3. **Integrate**

Embed prioritized behaviors into defined solutions—products, services, or interventions—to achieve [Solution Market Fit](/glossary/solution-market-fit/).

*Example:* Instagram integrated intuitive photo-sharing features directly into their core app experience.

### 4. **Verify**

Systematically track outcomes against explicit behavioral KPIs to confirm effectiveness and sustainability.

*Example:* Healthcare programs track specific KPIs such as vaccination rates to confirm behavioral interventions’ effectiveness.

### 5. **Enhance**

Refine and optimize solutions systematically based on ongoing data, ensuring long-term impact and scalability.

*Example:* Vaccine programs continually refine messaging and outreach strategies based on user response and behavioral data.

> **Executive Heuristic:** Define goals clearly, research rigorously, integrate behaviors strategically, verify outcomes consistently, and enhance solutions continuously. DRIVE outcomes, don’t guess them.
